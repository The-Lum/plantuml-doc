## Have a break: resolve a Sudoku...

Sometimes, when modeling, it's good to have a break....

You can use **PlantUML** to create [Sudoku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku), like in the following example:

```plantuml
@startuml
sudoku
@enduml
```
The sudoku is randomly generated.

It is also possible to generate a specific [Sudoku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) by providing its seed:

```plantuml
@startuml
sudoku 45azkdf4sqq
@enduml
```
