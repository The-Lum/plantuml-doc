## Vote for your syntax!

We do not want to force users to learn some new syntax for this wiki.

So this website will *transparently* allow users to use their preferred syntax.

Right now, only three syntaxes are (partially) supported:
* [Asciidoc syntax](syntax-asciidoc)
* [Dokuwiki syntax](syntax-dokuwiki)
* [Markdown syntax](syntax-markdown)

You can vote to choose which others syntaxes should also be supported.

You just have to click on one vote button:

* [I vote for Asciidoc Syntax](vote:asciidoctor) (**Already working**)
* [I vote for Confluence Markup](vote:confluence)
* [I vote for Creole syntax](vote:creole)
* [I vote for Dokuwiki syntax](vote:dokuwiki) (**Already working**)
* [I vote for Markdown syntax](vote:markdown) (**Already working**)
* [I vote for MediaWiki syntax](vote:mediawiki)
* [I vote for pandoc syntax](vote:pandoc)
* [I vote for another syntax](vote:another) *(Please update the pool in that case or use the post-it to indicate which syntax you're thinking of)*

(Tooltips on vote buttons display vote results.)
